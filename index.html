        , or "Lotso" for short, is the main antagonist from the movie Toy Story 3. 
        He is a large, pink teddy bear that smells like strawberries. <br>
        He was a beloved toy until his owner accidentally dropped him and left him. 
        When Lotso came back to the owner, he saw that he was replaced by a different toy and became evil.
